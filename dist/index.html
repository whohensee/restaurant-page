        <h1>The Restaurant on the Edge of the Universe</h1>
        <img src="../src/img/lightburst.jpg" alt="A delicious sunburst.">
        <p>Some people have often said just how wonderful the restaurant on the edge of
            the universe can be. The dishes are considered by mere mortals to be difficult
            to comprehend, and even harder to eat. How can one devour a concept? How can one
            simply savour light, or mortality, or the greater plan for the universe? Still,
            this has never stopped our chefs from creating the most ambitious menu that has
            ever been developed in all the parallel universes (including the ones that have
            been served to our more <em>discerning</em> customers). Please visit us if you
            find yourself traveling through this timeline, and be sure to enjoy your experience.
            If it is grand enough, perhaps we will add it to the menu.
        </p>
